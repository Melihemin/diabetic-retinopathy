## Diabetic Retinopathy Segmentation
In this application, it processes medical images of people with diabetic retinopathy and makes masking to facilitate disease detection.
The "EventNet5B" model, which has a high accuracy rate in application, was included in the training together with the "imagenet" weights, and the training could not be completed due to the low system characteristics during the training. Education continues to yield results. It will be published soon with new functions.
